                    <h1>Vaccines Don't Cause Autism</h1>
                    
                    <p>Before your baby turns 6 months old it is recommended that you have them vaccinated against: Diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, haemophilus influenzae type b, polio, pneumococcal and rotavirus. However, some people are hesitant to get all of these vaccines because of their effects and the ingredients that they contain, some even go as far as to say that they can cause autism. Autism however is caused by genetics, when the genetics of a person aren't perfect it can cause autism spectrum disorders and once a baby is born there is nothing that can change their genetics, even vaccines.<br><br>The main ingredient that has raised concern that vaccines causes autism in children 6 months-2 years old is thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative in vaccines used to prevent contamination in multi dose vials of the influenza vaccine. However due to this concern it has been looked into a lot. Since 2003 there have been over 9 CDC funded studies none of which have found any sort of link between ASD and thimerosal-containing vaccines. Results show that the total number of antigens from the vaccines were the same in kids with and without ASD (autism spectrum disorders.)<br><br>Thimerosal contains ethyl mercury it is a mild form of mercury that is naturally occurring in soil, water, food as well as within the human body. While large amounts can be harmful, especially for children, the amount in vaccines is very minimal and is considered safe by the WHO. The dose is significantly less than the amount found in your system and is unable to significantly hurt you. Ethyl mercury only remains within your body for up to 1 week, making its ability to cause damage significantly lower than its counterpart, methylmercury. Methylmercury remains in the human body for up to 1.5 months, making it much more deadly than ethyl mercury. Methylmercury is not found in any vaccines. <br><br>In 1999 thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines to reduce the amount of mercury that children were exposed to because of a concern about the high levels. After many tests the FDA was required by law to drastically reduce mercury exposure to infants, one of the ways they did this was getting rid of mercury from vaccines and only leaving trace amounts where it is absolutely necessary. <br><br>After all of this there is now only one childhood vaccine containing Ethyl mercury, the influenza vaccine that is packaged in multi dose vials. In the case of the influenza vaccine trace amounts of thimerosal are required because without it the vaccine could become infected with bacteria and if you receive a vaccine infected with bacteria it is very deadly. Getting the disease that the vaccine would have prevented would result in permanent damage if not death. This far outweighs the very low risk, if any of other effects caused by getting your child vaccinated in the first place. Currently, there are thimerosal free alternatives that are available for your child if you are at all concerned about the overall effects of thimerosal.  </p>
